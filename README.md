This is the repo for "Dual-Branch Neural Network for Bridging Semantic Gap in Harmful Meme Detection".

# Dataset
We have used Harm-C and Harm-P for the experimentats in this work. The dataset and train/test splits can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/MOMENTA)

# Feature Extraction
For visual and textual features with [ViT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/vit), [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bert), [CLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/clip) and [BLIP-2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/blip-2), we have used Hugging Face.
